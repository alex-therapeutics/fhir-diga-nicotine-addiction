## Representing an app user/patient

The DiGA user (patient) will be represented using the `SelfReportedNicotineUsingPatient` resource. Since there will be different information available on the patient for different DiGAs, this is a flexible profile allowing all defaults on `Patient`. There are however two optional extensions to quickly give information on this person's common triggers for nicotine usage and interventions that have been effective for this person.
