This guide describes how to implement the FHIR resources located in the [treat-nicotine-usage-diga](https://simplifier.net/treat-nicotine-usage-diga/) project. You can download the latest package release at [Simplify](https://simplifier.net/treat-nicotine-usage-diga/~packages).

The FHIR resources included in this package are used for Digital Health Applications (DiGAs) that treat nicotine usage (F17.2 ICD-10) using methods from cognitive behavioural therapy for patients who self-report to the DiGA without involvement from medical professionals.

There is a more extensive text available in the standard submitted to the [vesta directory](https://github.com/alex-therapeutics/fhir-diga-nicotine-addiction/releases/download/standard-1.0/standard.pdf).
